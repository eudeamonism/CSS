//Get Rid of White Space
-Body has a default margin.
-Set that to zero.

//What is margin collapsing?
When a block element margin meets the other block element's margin. The weird things is that the bigger margin will prevail. Therefore, we need to utilize

margin-top or
margin-bottom

//Shorthand css
border: 2px dashed orange

vs

border-width: 2px
border-style: dashed
border-color: orange

//MARGIN CSSS
margin-top: 5px
margin-right: 5px
margin-bottom: 5px
margin-left: 5px

!!!margin:  top, right, bottom, left.
!!!margin: top&bottom, left&right
!!!margin: all sizes


//Width and Heighth
When I added margin instead, it would cut of the coloring I used for 100% width and Heighth. Adding padding, however, makes the color grow.

//Hierarchy
html
body
main
If you see main to heighth 100%
and do the same to body and then
set html to 100% you will get a nearly full screen other than any other elements blocking it.

HOWEVER a short cut was to just set the height to 350px or something like that to achieve a big color block
-WIDTH 100% is default however so you dont't have to set it, but we do this for learning.


///BOX MODEL ................
Content Box, way of calculating all extra perimeters

This sets a cap!!!

box-sizing: content-box;


//This is best!!
!!This includes cap but includes all perimeters.
box-sizing: border-box;


//Adding navigation bar
So I created a header tag with a tag for the title of the nav bar, then I created another nav with ul and many li....

TIP -- You need padding, at least 5px for each element, or the text sits at the edge of the boundary and creates white space.

//Using display feature for nav bar

We created the same class for each li. We follow a nomenclature
We in the main file and we are accessing an item in the nav so
main-nav__item  --> is the class

--Anchor tags only take content space while each li take the whole line -- this is inline.

Inline items cannot get padding

//Display Display

display: block makes it where the dotted indentations is gone.
display: none --> removes the content from visibility
display: inline-block --> mixes behavior, we use

//COMBINATORS Grabbing child element in CSSS
}
.main-header > div {

}

-- This grabs the div inside the main-header any div inside that div.


--MAKING NAV ALL Inline
MAKE SURE THAT NO SPACE BETWEEN DIV AND OTHER DIV
MAKE SURE TO SUBTRACT CALCULATE(100% - X)
